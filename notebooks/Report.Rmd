### Preprocessing

We undertook a structured preprocessing phase to prepare the dataset for effective machine learning modeling. This phase focused on cleaning the data, addressing class imbalances, and formatting the dataset to optimize training and evaluation. Our process was divided into the following steps:

#### 1. Data Cleaning

We began by ensuring the dataset’s integrity and consistency. Following the insights gained during the EDA, we reduced the number of columns, getting rid of non-contributive features. The following steps were taken to clean the data:

-   **Column Unification:** We consolidated related columns under the `has_secondary_use` group into a single column. This approach addressed inconsistencies and centralized the information for easier interpretation.

-   **Column Elimination:** Based on our earlier analysis, we decided to eliminate columns such as `building_id`, `plan_configuration`, `legal_ownership_status`, `count_families`, `has_secondary_use_police`, `has_secondary_use_gov_office`, `has_secondary_use_health_post`, `has_secondary_use_industry`, `has_secondary_use_institution`, `has_secondary_use_school`, and `has_secondary_use_other`. By doing so, we reduced dimensionality and noise, leaving 26 columns in the dataset.

#### 2. Train-Test Split

To ensure a robust evaluation of our models, we split the dataset into training and testing subsets. We used a stratified approach to maintain the distribution of the target variable across both subsets. Using the `caret` library, we implemented this split to ensure a clear and reproducible methodology. We opted for an 80-20 split, with 80% of the data allocated for training and 20% for testing. This division allowed us to train the models on a substantial portion of the data while retaining a separate set for evaluation.

#### 3. One-Hot Encoding

We transformed categorical variables into numerical format using one-hot encoding. This step involved creating binary columns for categories within the features `land_surface_condition`, `foundation_type`, `roof_type`, `ground_floor_type`, `other_floor_type`, and `position`. While this increased the number of columns, it made the data compatible with machine learning algorithms. We saved the one-hot encoded dataset as `onehot` for future analysis.

#### 4. Correlation Analysis

To address multicollinearity, we performed a correlation analysis. We identified two pairs of highly correlated columns: `land_surface_condition_n` and `position_s`, and `land_surface_condition_t` and `position_t`. In each pair, we retained the column with the higher variance to preserve the most informative features. We named the resulting dataset `filtered_onehot` and saved it for further analysis.

#### 5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Next, we applied PCA to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality. After standardizing the data to ensure consistent scaling, we used the Kaiser criterion to retain 13 principal components. These components captured significant variance while simplifying the dataset. Once PCA was completed, we reintroduced the target variable, `damage_grade`, and saved this version as `pca` for future steps.

#### 6. Handling Imbalanced Data

Addressing class imbalance in the target variable was a priority. We adopted two different techniques to improve the dataset’s balance:

-   **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):** We generated synthetic samples for the minority class using SMOTE. By creating new instances based on the nearest neighbors, we enhanced the representation of the minority class, enabling the model to learn effectively from all classes. We carried out the implementation using the `smotefamily` package in R, ensuring practical applicability and reproducibility. This balanced dataset was saved as `smote`.

-   **Weight Allocation:** We applied another technique to mitigate the effects of class imbalance. We assigned weights to samples based on their class distribution. This method prioritized minority class instances during training, reducing prediction bias and improving overall performance. We saved this weighted dataset as `weighted` for subsequent analysis.

### Supervised Analysis

The supervised analysis involved training and evaluating multiple machine learning models to predict the damage grade of buildings after an earthquake. We used the preprocessed datasets (`onehot`, `filtered_onehot`, `pca`, `smote`, and `weighted`) to compare the performance of various algorithms and preprocessing techniques.

Specifically, we decided to apply the following algorithms, available in the `caret` package:

-   **Random Forest (RF):** A robust ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and generalization. Random Forest is well-suited for classification tasks and can handle high-dimensional data effectively. In particular, we used the ranger implementation of Random Forest, which offers enhanced performance.

-   **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM):** An iterative ensemble method that builds decision trees sequentially, focusing on instances with higher prediction errors. GBM is known for its high predictive power and ability to capture complex relationships in the data.

-   **Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB):** A variant of Gradient Boosting that introduces randomness into the algorithm, improving generalization and reducing overfitting. SGB is particularly effective for large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.

It is important to note that we also applied hyperparameter tuning to optimize the models' performance. The `caret` package provided a convenient framework for tuning the algorithms and selecting the best hyperparameters through grid search and cross-validation. By tuning the models, we aimed to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities, ensuring robust performance on unseen data. As a result, we generated 15 different models from the combination of the three algorithms and five datasets.

Another key aspect of the supervised analysis was evaluating the models' performance using appropriate metrics. We focused on the following evaluation metrics to assess the models' effectiveness: 

- **Confusion Matrix:** As the target variable is categorical, we have focused on using this matrix and its metrics as it provides a lot of information about the model. In addition, we decided to use the extended version (`mode = "everything"`) that provides additional information such as the F1-Score, which is useful to us as it is the evaluation metric used in the ml-olympiad. 

- **Area Under the Curve (AUC):** This metric is particularly useful for binary classification problems, providing insights into the model's ability to distinguish between classes. A higher AUC-ROC score indicates better performance, with a value of 0.5 representing random guessing and 1 representing perfect classification. In our case, we saw that R allowed the use of a multi-class auc function and initially used it. However, after the follow-up class, we read the paper [@hand2001simple] in which the implementation is discussed and discovered that in 50% of the cases, the results provided are incorrect. Therefore, following the professor's recommendation, we made use of the Python library defined in
*Classification performance assessment for imbalanced multiclass data* [@aguilar2024classification], as it obtained really good results compared to the previous one, and we implemented a python wrapper in R using the `reticulate` library to use this python library (`imcp`). 

#### Implementation

To reduce the code duplication and improve the readability of the supervised training, we implemented 3 functions to train the models, generate the confusion matrix and calculate the AUC-ROC score given some information like the `algorithm`, the `tuning grid`, the `dataset`, the `location` to store the predictions, the `test` dataset, etc.

#### In-depth analysis selection

Since we obtained 15 models as a result of the training, we have decided to choose 6 in order to comment on the most interesting results. In choosing these models, we have relied on the models with the best precision, recall, F1-Score and AUC; resulting in:

- **Best precision**: `rf_filtered` and `rf_weighted`

- **Best recall**: `rf_weighted` and `gbm_pca`

- **Best f1 (mean)**: `rf_onehot` and `gbm_smote`

- **Best AUC**: `gbm_filtered` and `gbm_smote`

In the section [supervised analysis results](#supervised-analysis-2) we will analyse the results provided by the rf_onehot, rf_filtered, rf_weigthed, gbm_filtered, gbm_pca and gbm_smote models.

### Supervised Analysis Results {#supervised-analysis-2}

In this section, we present the results of the supervised analysis, focusing on the performance of the machine learning models across different datasets and algorithms. We will present the six best models based on the metrics we have mentioned above: precision, recall, F1 Score, and AUC for multi-class.

#### rf_onehot model

We have selected the rf_onehot model as one of the top-performing models as it has achived the highest F1 Score between all models, with a value of 0.523. The precision and recall values for this model are 0.567 and 0.519, respectively. The AUC for multi-class is 0.436.

#### rf_filtered model

The reason for selecting the rf_filtered model as one of the top-performing models is that it has been the model with the highest precision classifying the classes 1 and 3, with values of 0.664 and 0.568. Its overall precision is 0.593 and the recall is 0.5. The F1 Score for this model is 0.475, and the AUC for multi-class is 0.432.

#### rf_weighted model

We have chosen the rf_weighted model as one of the top-performing models due to it has the highest recall for the classes 1 and 3, with values of 0.719 and 0.662, respectively, and it also has the highest precision for the class 2, with a value of 0.567. The overall precision and recall values are 0.501 and 0.559, respectively. The F1 Score for this model is 0.501, and the AUC for multi-class is 0.424.

## Kaiser Criterion

The Kaiser criterion is a widely used method for determining the number of principal components to retain during PCA. It suggests retaining components with eigenvalues greater than 1, as these components explain more variance than a single original variable. By selecting components with eigenvalues above this threshold, we can capture the most significant information in the data while reducing dimensionality. The Kaiser criterion is a valuable tool for balancing the trade-off between complexity and information retention in PCA, ensuring that the transformed dataset remains informative and interpretable.
